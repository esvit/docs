## What is Nomi API?

The **Nomi API** is a RESTful interface to the Nomi management accounting system, designed for small and medium-sized businesses. It allows external systems to integrate seamlessly with Nomi by programmatically managing core financial entities.

## Basics

All API requests are made to the base URL: `https://api.nomi.tools`. The API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returns data in JSON format.
Body parameters should be sent as JSON in the request body, and query parameters should be included in the URL.
Authentication is done using personal private tokens, which can be generated in the Nomi Development page. Include the PPT in the `Authorization` header of each request as `Basic YOUR_EMAIL:YOUR_PPT`.

## Rate Limits
The number of requests per second per account depends on your subscription plan. On free plans, the limit is 10 requests per second. For paid plans, the limit is 100 requests per second.
If the limit is exceeded, the API will respond with status code 429 and the header "Too Many Requests".


## API Key
API key management is available in **Development â†’ Personal Private Tokens**.

On this page, you can create and revoke PPTs (Personal Private Tokens)

To authenticate using an API key, include the basic authorization in **every** request to the server.
